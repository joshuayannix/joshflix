This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction and Technology Used
This React app pulls in movie and TV data from the OMDB API. Similar to a an ecommerce shopping cart, the user can click the Add to My List button to save a movie to their favorites list. I used Redux for state management and to keep track of the favorites list.

Clicking on a movie opens the modal element (takem from the Material UI library) with the option to add to the list. I used Firebase to host the project, and for Google authentication for user login. I used React Router for page navigation.
